## Problems Encountered and Solved

### Keystone.JS

KeystoneJS is a CMS for NodeJS.  It does the bulk of the work related to presenting database materials in a pretty user interface with the ability to easily edit any information.  Keystone is not awful itself, but did not work for the requirements of our project.  Keystoneâ€™s problem for us was in its flexibility.  Keystone is not able to be customized to the extent required to implement the functionality and user experience that we wanted for our project.  Obviously, we did not know this prior to choosing it to act as our CMS.

At the time that Sprint 1 was coming to a close, we had already invested too much time into learning how Keystone works and forcing it to work to abandon it and find something else for the Sprint 1 presentation.  For this reason, we were committed to using Keystone for Sprint 1, and our projections going into Sprint 2 were delayed.  Knowing what we know now, we would have not chosen to use Keystone.  The situation was not an entire loss, however.  Despite causing the major delay, delving into Keystone helped us learn how a professional-looking CMS works, which eventually helped us implement the functionality that the project uses now.
